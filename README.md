## Notes
This module will not work if you're using MagiskHide Props, DNS Changer, GPU Rendering Changer, OpenGL ES Version Changer, Touch Improvement, Internet Tweak, Virtual Memory Tweak, and RAM Management Tweak (Memory Improvement, Activity Manager Tweak, etc) or others similar modules with it.

If you have a problem, maybe force close when opening an app, blackscreen, or something like that. It means your device doesn't support GPU Rendering, the solution is Reinstall ML+ module and change GPU Rendering which supports your device or use Default GPU Rendering (OpenGL ES) to solve the problem.

> And also, this module works in all games not only MLBB, called for MLBB only because of the unlocker method and my personal use that made this module to play MLBB, thanks...
